# Introduction

### Welcome to the Räterreich mod for the game Hearts of Iron 4!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to Räterreich. It is because of people like you that makes this mod possible!

### Why read this?

>By following this document, you will hopefully respect your fellow developers in this open source mod. In return, the developers will give positive feedback when addressing your issues and pull requests and also help with the code.

### What kinds of contributions are we looking for?

> Currently we are looking for many contributions! We recommend joining our Discord server to get more information about what roles we are currently looking for - https://discord.gg/MUuVWfw. 

# Ground Rules
### Set expectations for behavior.

> Responsibilities
* Always make sure to be up to date with the master branch!
* Ensure your code works before creating a pull request.
* Try to keep feature commits to the right branches - this will make it easier to debug if something is not working correctly.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds!

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to Räterreich? Firstly check out our Discord server for more information and tips - https://discord.gg/MUuVWfw. If you are not given a specific region to work on, you can always work on the created issues in our log:
* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Normal issues - issues that will take some more time to fix and test.

### Have you never contributed to open source before?
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

>1. Create a fork of the master branch.
2. Clone the fork.
3. Make the changes you want in a new branch.
4. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. (Currently none)
    * Test your changes before making a pull request!
    * Create a pull request.

# How to report a bug
> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

>1. What version of Hearts of Iron 4 are you using? (This can sometimes differ depending if the mod has been updated for the new game patches)
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?
